In this page I'm going to show you some data science project I made using Google Colab, if you are interested you can click on them and see the GitHub repository where you can find the code and the data involved. 

## [Lending Club Loan Data Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/Lending_ClubLoanDataProject_NeuralNetwork.ipynb)
For this project I will be using a set based on the LendingClub DataSet [obtained from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club).
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

## [House Sales in King County Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/kerasRegressionProject.ipynb)
For this project I will use a dataset taken from Kaggle to predict house pricing using regression by means of a neural network. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, Washington, it includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The deep neural network was imported from Keras using TensorFlow.

## [Data Visualization Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/DataVisualizationProject.ipynb)
In this project I will use some of the most famous Python's libraries for data visualization such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The aim is to do some exploratory data analysis from real world dataset taken from the web.
In the first project, there will be examinated some 911 calls made from Montgomery County, PA, data were taken from Kaggle.
In the latest, I used data taken from Stooq, an online free repository of financial data, in order to investigate stock prices of some of the most important US banks during the financial crysis started in 2007-2008.

## [Iris Dataset Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/IrisFlowerDatasetProject_Support_Vector_Machines.ipynb)
For this project, I will be using the famous Iris flower data set.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The aim is to classify a given flower using Support Vector Machine Algorithm.

## [Lending Club Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/LendingClubProject_DecisionTreesAndRandomForest.ipynb)
For this project there will be explored publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. The goal is to create a model that will help predict this by means of Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers.
There will be used lending data from 2007-2010, trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 

## [SMS Spam Project - Overview](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/UciProject_NLP.ipynb)
The SMS Spam Collection v.1 is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam an was taken from the University of California (UCI) free datasets. The goal is to predict wheter an SMS is ham or spam given its text, for this purpose it will be used Natural Language Processing. 


## Other Exercises
The previous project all stands to real world data, these project are based on artificial data and therefore are not very meaningfull, there are just exercises used to practice my skills with some of the most popular and used machine learning algorithm, such as: [Linear Regression](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/LinearRegressionProject.ipynb), [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/LogisticRegressionProject.ipynb), [K Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/KNearestNeighborsProject.ipynb), [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/NickOLeeney/data-science-projects/blob/main/KMeansClusteringProject.ipynb) and so on.
